#CITS3403 todo list

##Things we still have to do
- Be able to edit items
  - ~~Todo items~~
- Send reminders
  - ~~Add due date to the item model (value can be null)~~
  - Add validations for due date and tests
  - Write function that sends email if item is less than one day till due date
  - Use cron or some other scheduling system to call that function every day/hour (probably better if we use day since we're only using date and not datetime and we won't take into account different timezones)
- Make sure there are tests for everything if possible...
- Make everything pretty @"@
  - ~~Create item form~~
  - ~~Have seperate all, completed and uncompleted blocks~~
  - Fix up typography, spacing between text
- Finish the help, about us, profile pages

Use 2 space indentation for EVERYTHING. ruby, html, js, everything.
